# AlgoBenchmark
 WPF/XAML program for benchmarking the performance, comparisons, and data type accesses of sorting algorithms on all input sizes of a certain range

The benchmarks are shown in graphs using ScottPlot's signal plot, with the X axis being the array sizes run, and the Y axis being the number of the respective metric occuring per array size. Lower scores mean better results, because it's the number of comparisons, type accesses, and elapsed time in ticks.
